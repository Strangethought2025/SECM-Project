This repository hosts the official model files, documentation, and simulation logic for **SECM (Societal Evolution Computational Model)**, a modular framework for analyzing macro-societal development under structural feedback constraints.

## 📘 Overview

SECM simulates the interaction between three primary axes:

- **X-axis**: Productive capacity (e.g. GDP, infrastructure)
- **Y-axis**: Social mobility cost and systemic friction (e.g. inequality)
- **Z-axis**: External disruptions (e.g. war, pandemics, trade shocks)

The model incorporates:

- A Red Queen mechanism on the Y-axis
- Dynamic collapse thresholds based on societal stress
- Tech bonus pools and innovation saturation
- Multi-stage simulation support
