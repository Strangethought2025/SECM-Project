## 📘 What is SECM?

SECM is a **three-axis computational model** designed to simulate macro-societal evolution under structural constraints and feedback loops. It does *not* attempt to model individuals, nor does it rely on traditional economic equilibrium theory.

Instead, it captures **systemic friction and instability** using dynamic social pressure models inspired by thermodynamics, class tension theory, and collapse mechanics.

### 🔺 The Three Axes of SECM

- **X-axis**: *Structural productive capacity* (e.g. energy-equivalent output, infrastructure)
- **Y-axis**: *Social opportunity cost* (e.g. inequality, class mobility barrier, economic friction)
- **Z-axis**: *Systemic pressure & external shocks* (e.g. war, fatigue, policy compression, trust collapse)

Together, these simulate:
- Red Queen dynamics on Y (running faster just to stay in place)
- Collapse thresholds modulated by Gini coefficients and savings rates
- Innovation bonus pools with saturation and decay
- A recursive social stress engine (Z-axis fatigue + shock + relief)
